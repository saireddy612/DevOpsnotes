Docker is the tool provides an image, which will be utilized by the kubernetes to create a container.
POD: its a smallest deployable unit in kubernetes. it is basically an abstract of container, In kubernetes we won't create container directly,
instead we look upon the POD. Multiple pods with same container is possible(ex: create a pods of nginx image). Each pod can have multiple
containers that dependent on each other.
NODE: VM's in the cluster where docker and kubernete is installed.
Replica: same pods with same container and image.

YAML:
>it is not a programming or scripting language.
>It is just a format to store data, like json, xml files
>It's very easy to read and write
>It's declarative in nature.
>Indentation(spacing) is important.
>In kubernetes the key is provided by the tool itself
>Value is written by user
>In the key we can have single value and multiple value.
