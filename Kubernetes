Docker is the tool used to create a container using kubernetes.
POD: its a smallest deployable unit in kubernetes. it is basically an abstract of container, In kubernetes we won't create container directly,
instead we look upon the POD. Multiple pods with same container is possible(ex: create a pods of nginx image).
NODE: VM's in the cluster where docker and kubernete is installed.
Replica: same pods with same container and image.
